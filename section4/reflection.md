## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?

I think I've been doing a pomodoro-esque schedule inadvertently.  I tend to work for a while, then get up and move a bit before continuing.  It feels pretty natural.

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?

I could focus pretty well for the duration of each exercise. My time estimations were pretty good except for classProperties exercise.  I didn't realize how much searching I would need
to do to find the things I needed.  Also, the instructions were (purposely?) pretty vague...

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?

An array is a variable that can hold multiple values and data types at once.  An object is a container for properties that can have methods done to/with it.

1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class
    Array.  This should just be a list of fixed names.
  * List of states and their capitals
    Array.  This is a list of fixed values.
  * List of things to pack for vacation
    Object.  This is a list, but it needs to be updatable.  Also, the things on the list need to be able to have values changed, like packed/unpacked status.
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow
    I would put this in an object.  The accounts would probably have additional information beyond the name.
  * List of student names and their cohort
    Because of the multiple data point on each entry, I would put this in an object.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake
    This would also be an object because of the multiple data points per entry.
  * All my favorite restaurants
    Object. I would want to include more than the name, like type of food or price point.

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?

A Spotify playlist would need to include: the name of the playlist, the list of tracks, wether or not a track has been played.  A track would need to include: artist, title, album, duration, lyrics, album art.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?

The concepts make sense.  I need more practice making them do stuff.  Syntax...  And Typos...
