## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

My educational history demonstrates my desire to keep learning.  I also resonated with the suggestion to keep reading.  I enjoy podcasts and NPR.  I will probably start listening to audio books while driving and doing housework.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
   1. Number - a number, fractions as decimals, no commas in large numbers
   2. String - an element that consists of letters and other characters, including numbers.  Wrapped in quotes.
   3. Boolean - evaluates wether something is true or false.  compares two values.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

```JavaScript
console.log('Hello World!')
```

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

    // The double backslashes will do the trick
    /* Code comments are used to make notes in
    your code to explain reasoning or describe
    what the code is doing.*/

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

    A variable is like a box that we can put something complicated in.  Then, when we need the complicated thing, we can just grab the box instead of remaking the complicated thing every time we need it.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

GrubHub is probably way more complicated than I can describe, but...  The logged in account button would need to have a variable that included a string that had the user name to display.  I'm sure that in totaling the cost of the items in the cart, some number variables would be necessary.  I suppose they could use a boolean if there were competing selections on a menu item, like 'add chicken' and 'make vegan'.  I'm sure there are much better, and subtle, ways to do all these things.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

Concatention is the making of a string out of several elements stuck together end to end.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?

When Amazon thanks you for your purchase it prints a message that includes your name and some other specific information, like an order number and potential shipping date.  This auto generated form might use concatention.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

I'm still not sure what booleans are actually used for...
