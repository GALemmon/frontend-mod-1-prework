## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?

I like the idea that a growth mindset is applicable to most career paths but especially coding.  I also really liked the idea of embracing failures/mistakes as a means of growth.

1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?

I really like learning and am pretty tenacious when it comes to solving problems.  However, I do sometimes tend to get a bit frustrated and don't always ask for help when it would be the best course of action.

1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

When checking out of Amazon.com, all of your previous payment methods are listed for you.

1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

Array methods are tools that you can use to manipulate the data in an array and its output.

1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

Loops allow you to run a piece of code over and over without having to rewrite it.  You can use an array with a loop to apply the same code to each of the elements in the array without having to rewrite the code for each element. A loop can be used without an array to do things like math and counting.

1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

Loops are kind of like a special machine that does one job and it will do that job until it runs out of supplies.

1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

I think I have a pretty solid grasp of the basics.  I'm sure it will solidify as I get more experience.
