## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think I ask questions when I need to.  I am enjoying the hunt for information and haven't gotten really stuck yet.  If I find myself beating my head against the wall, I'll be sure to ask before I waste too much time.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

I didn't have any real problems.  I did have to do a lot more googling this section.  I wanted more streamlined ways to do a couple of things and I had problems finding what I wanted.  I know that will all come with time.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

A conditional statemnt uses the value of a variable to determine wether or not a piece of code will run.  If the trash is full, I will empty the trash can.  If not, I won't.  A lot of sites determine wether you are a logged in user or not.  At least some of their functionality is determined by the state of that variable.

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.

You use `if` and `else if` lines.  The program starts with the first `if` statement.  If it is true, the program stops and completes the task as written.  If the first conditional is false, then the program moves to the the next `else if` line.  If this line is true, then the action is completed.  You can have as many `else if` lines as you need.  The final line in the conditional is probably going to be an `else` line.  This will provide instructions for any other set of conditions.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?

They are called logical operators.  The logical AND is `&&`.  Logical OR is `||`.  Logical NOT is `!`.  `&&` outputs true if both conditiions are true.  `||` outputs true if at least one of the conditions is true.  `!` outputs true if the condition is false.

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?

I think I have a pretty good grasp of the basic material.  There is a lot of nuance that I know I'm missing.
